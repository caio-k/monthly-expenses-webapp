# Monthly Expenses

*This is a personal project that I did to improve my skills in web development.*

Monthly Expenses is a tool for managing personal expenses. In short, the user can register their "initial money" and "expenses" for each month, and then see some metrics about their spending.

The technology I'm using on the frontend is `ReactJS` and on the backend it's `Spring Boot (Java)`.

I hosted this application on Heroku and you can access it at [this link](https://monthly-expenses-app.herokuapp.com/).

##### Next steps: develop test cases and improve the UI / UX.
